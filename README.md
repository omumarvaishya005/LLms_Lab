# 🚀 LLM Lab – End-to-End Large Language Model Implementations  

This repository is a **complete package** for working with **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.  
It takes you from **basic foundations** (embeddings, tokenization, transformers) to **advanced real-world applications** such as **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **vector database integration**, **fine-tuning models**, and **building production-ready chatbots**.  

It combines the power of **LangChain** and **Hugging Face Transformers**, while also supporting both **open-source** (LLaMA, Falcon, Mistral, BLOOM, etc.) and **closed-source** (OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude) models.
